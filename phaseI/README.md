# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

There were various caveats to the methods we implemented. The biggest caveat was not having access to actual users to query or test with. As a result, our conclusions of what we believe to be a good design or what potential user needs are may not be accurate. Our personas and scenarios are a good educated pitch to envision how our product will be used and valued, but it is not a concrete confirmation. If we had access to actual users, we could get a much more accurate and clear understanding of what our users really want. Another caveat was not having a budget for implementing our research methods. As a result, the research may not be as thorough or in-depth as industry standards would hope it to be. If we had a budget, then we could utilize far more resources, such as implementing other research methods that require money to help bolster and broaden our research findings.
