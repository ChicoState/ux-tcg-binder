# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

### Usability Test Protocol

The protocol consists of three sections: **user background**, **tasks**, and **debrief.** 

The study took a formative approach having participants rate the ease of a task rather than the evaluators rate the performance of the participant. Additionally, participants were asked to think-alound during each task. 

### User Background

The background section seeks to determine the participants previous experience with trading card games and applications. Five questions were asked:

#### Q1: How long have you played trading card games (if at all)?
* Determining if a user has experienced playing trading card games is important because if the user is unfamiliar, they would likely not be able to provide useful insights into the design of the application. 

#### Q2: How serious are you about trading card games?
* Different ideas and viewpoints can come from participants that are unexperienced, casual, or competitive with trading card games. 

#### Q3: What trading card game applications have you used before if any?
* Participants that have experienced applications developed by competitors can provide useful insights into industry conventions, design, and features. 

#### Q4: What do you expect a trading card game application to provide to best serve your needs?
* Implementation of expected features is important to fulfilling user needs and staying consistent with industry convention. 

#### Q5: What features would you expect to not see in a trading card game application?
* Participants can provide both positive and negative outlooks regarding unexpected features. A majority of competitors may be lacking a highly desired feature or, opposingly, all possess the same undesired one.

### Tasks
Tasks are designed to pinpoint potential caveats in the design of the prototype and observe participant behaviors as they navigate through the UI. Each task asks the participant to perform a function starting from the landing page. Afterwards, each task is determined a success or failure dependant on the participants completion of the task. Participants are then asked to rate the difficulty on a scale of “Very Difficult” (1) to “Very Easy” (5). 

#### Task 1
Imagine you use a tcg app to track your physical card collection digitally. You have received a handful of new magic the gathering cards and want to make sure that your digital collection reflects your physical collection. See if you can make your digital collection reflect the new cards that you have received.

* The first task aims to introduce the participant to the UI and, simultaneously, reveal the mental model constructed through its naviagtion. Additionally, recording interactions with key features such as the scanner sought to discover potential design flaws. 


#### Task 2
Most tcg applications allow users to post deck lists and share them with other users. See if you can figure out how to share a deck that you have created with other users of the application as well as making the deck visibility public. 

* With the participant better oriented with the prototype, the second task seeks to test the “create new deck” page/feature and use the dropdown options to make it public. Additionally, observations on the level of feedback provided by the prototype to the user were examined to see if there was enough to infer completion of the task. 

#### Task 3
You are looking to build a new deck to take to your local trading card game store to play against other players. Use the application to help you find a deck that you would like to create.

* This task aims to test if the user can navigate to the “Create New Deck” page and either manually add or scan in new cards to the new deck. 

#### Task 4
Many applications offer details about market listings and prices for cards. Examine what market/pricing details are provided to users. See if you can retrieve enough information to feel confident that you can sell your card if you so desired.

* The last task has the participant attempt to navigate to the “Market Listings” page and examine the market details of a selected card. 

### Debrief
The debrief section compiles participants thoughts and opinions about their experience with the application. Seven questions were asked:

#### Q1: Did your experiences match your expectations of what a trading card game application should be?
* Staying true to industry convention is important as straying too far can introduce confusing features or themes. 

#### Q2: Which tasks were satisfying to complete? Which ones were difficult?
* Understanding where participants were comportable/disatisfied with navigation, use of features, and the UI, depict a better picture of where to make QoL (Quality of Life) adjustments. 

#### Q3: What was the best aspect of your experience using our app?
* Determining the best aspect of the prototype can help develop other parts by using similar conventions/designs. 

#### Q4: What was the worst aspect of your experience using our app?
* Determining the worst aspect helps determine what feature/design may be missing or poorly implemented. 

#### Q5: What are some changes you would recommend?
* Recommended changes can help fufill user needs and create a better, more feature-rich application.

#### Q6: Does the organization and navigation between pages make sense?
* Evaluating the ease at which participants can navigate the UI is crucial to developing a an application that feels easy to use and flow through. 

#### Q7: Are there any other features you would like to see implemented?
* Discovering any missing or desired features can help fufill user desires tremendously. 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
