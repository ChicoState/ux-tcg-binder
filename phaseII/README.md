# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

There were numerous caveats that needed to be taken into consideration with this phase of the project. Firstly, like the previous phase, we lacked a budget. As a result, we were unable to hire other experts to consult and unable to conduct more thorough research methods that may have yielded more accurate results. Secondly, our team possesses limited experience in working with Figma and creating wireframes in general. This may have resulted in suboptimal designs or questionable design choices that may have made it more difficult for users to use our product. Thirdly, while cognitive walkthroughs can provide useful feedback, they come with some important drawbacks: 1) They may not all be accurate depictions of our product due to there being numerous ways to accomplish the same goal and 2) they are narrow in scope so they may miss a lot of other elements such as efficiency or other usability attributes. Lastly, our team's questions regarding informal feedback were targeted to software engineers and not to the people who will actually use our product. The reason this is important is because the feedback we receive will not be demographically representative and contain certain biases. Also, the software engineers are much more knowledgeable when it comes to using technology and electronic applications. Their previous knowledge, experiences, and problem solving techniques will be vastly different from our target audience, which can result in further discrepancies between what we believe our users need and what they actually need.
