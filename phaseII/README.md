# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

TCG_Binder aims to provide a platform where trading card game players can effortlessly manage their physical trading card collections digitally. The focus for this phase of the project has been to refine our product wireframes and to identify any parts of our design that would make our product harder to use. We were able to accomplish these goals by conducting cognitive walkthroughs using personas and scenarios as well as receiving informal feedback from other software engineering teams. 

## Methods

### Cognitive Walkthroughs

Each member of the UX team performed an individual analysis of two personas in total. The chosen personas were never both from the same UX team. The data used to perform the Walkthroughs came from the chosen UX team's **Wireframes** and **Personas and Scenarios report**. A total of two UX evaluators performed Cognitive Walkthroughs on us. The personas they chose were [Timmy Johnson](https://chicosoftwareteams.slack.com/archives/C0472SZGT8T/p1710274988126439?thread_ts=1710273278.330969&cid=C0472SZGT8T) and [Eric Ericson](https://chicosoftwareteams.slack.com/archives/C0472SZGT8T/p1710275409415429?thread_ts=1710273278.330969&cid=C0472SZGT8T). 
The two main questions each evaluator answered while performing the CWs were:

* Will the user know what to do at this step?

* If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?

The Walkthroughs were performed by imagining how a persona would reach a goal by interacting with the application via the current wireframe layout. Step-by-step notes of a personas' interaction with the app using the two questions above were documented in hopes of providing insights into how to improve the user experience. 

### Informal Feedback

Informal Feedback was gathered from the responses of the undergraduate Software Engineering students during the Sprint II demonstration. The questions asked to the SWE students were:

* Are the aesthetics of the current application appealing?

* Are there any design decisions that could be changed or modified?

These questions were designed to pinpoint where user design improvements can be made to the current build of the application.

## Findings

### Cognitive Walkthroughs

From the CWs produced by the two external UX team members, we discovered that our [card collection page](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/95311436/321001684-f41dbbdb-0308-4717-b1aa-5a4a1069a4e1.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.afBR5OGrQZ3iPJARHB3mdH0oncwWqGhuEtK57bAcvgE) was confusing to users. Missing features such as card filtering/categorization, count of cards owned, displaying more cards at once, and a scroll wheel made finding cards difficult for our evaluator. Additionally, we discovered that we lacked any feature to add new cards to the collection page. 

### Informal Feedback

The two questions asked to our fellow Software Engineers provided further suggestions to improve the user experience. For example, giving more visual emphasis to adding new cards rather than searching. Because our app is for card collection, having the add card feature prominent will decrease the time users are scanning over the app. Additionally, we were provided with many suggestions regarding deck features. When a deck was selected, users wanted to see more information such as the top three cards or similar decks. Likewise, feedback suggested that our profile feature was too prominent and our app should rather focus on displaying deck information. Finally, sharing decks with others through a link, QR code, or friend code was desired.

## Conclusions

From the cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback we were able to identify potential issues with our design and make changes to them accordingly. Through the cognitive walkthrough we were able to identify steps in our process that we could simplify and change elements of to make the use of our product more intuitive. With the information that we learned in the informal feedback we were able to identify pieces of our design that were important to the users and improve upon them to provide more information to the user. Overall the information we learned in this phase helped us to refine our product design and connect with our future users.

## Caveats

There were numerous caveats that needed to be taken into consideration with this phase of the project. Firstly, like the previous phase, we lacked a budget. As a result, we were unable to hire other experts to consult and unable to conduct more thorough research methods that may have yielded more accurate results. Secondly, our team possesses limited experience in working with Figma and creating wireframes in general. This may have resulted in suboptimal designs or questionable design choices that may have made it more difficult for users to use our product. Thirdly, while cognitive walkthroughs can provide useful feedback, they come with some important drawbacks: 1) They may not all be accurate depictions of our product due to there being numerous ways to accomplish the same goal and 2) they are narrow in scope so they may miss a lot of other elements such as efficiency or other usability attributes. Lastly, our team's questions regarding informal feedback were targeted to software engineers and not to the people who will actually use our product. The reason this is important is because the feedback we receive will not be demographically representative and contain certain biases. Also, the software engineers are much more knowledgeable when it comes to using technology and electronic applications. Their previous knowledge, experiences, and problem solving techniques will be vastly different from our target audience, which can result in further discrepancies between what we believe our users need and what they actually need.
