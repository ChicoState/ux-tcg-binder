# Wireframes
### To best explain our wireframes, we will walk through the steps a user would take to register or log into their account, create a new custom collection/deck and then add a card to it.
1. When the user first launches the app, they will be met with this screen: the "Landing" page. They are prompted to either log in or sign up. Let's assume that this user does not have an account registered with us, so they would hit the "sign up" button.

2. After hitting the sign up button, the user is redirected to the "Registration" page. Here, they will be prompted to enter in their email and password. Once they are done, they will hit the "get started" button to conclude the registration process. On the other hand, if the user was simply logging in,
   then they would still be directed to this page and enter in their credentials, but the button would display "login" instead of "get started."

4. Once the user is logged into their account, they are redirected to the "Main/Home" page. This page contains three sections: 1) a preview of the user's custom made collections, 2) a preview of collections created by other users who decided to share them publicly, and 3) some cards that the user might be interested in acquiring. Since
   our goal is to create a new deck/collection, we would hit the plus icon found at the right hand side of the "your custom decks" row.

5. After hitting the plus icon, the user is redirected to the "Create New Deck" page. Here, the user is prompted to provide the name of the new deck, what genre of trading card game it is, and what it's visibility should be. The genre and visiblity are both selected through a drop down menu. For genre, it would offer responses such as "Pokemon" or "Yu-Gi-Oh!" and for visibility it would either be "Public" or "Private." Once the user has entered in all the information, they will hit the "create deck" button.

6. Once the new deck has been created, they will be redirected to the "Collections" page. Here the user will see the collection name and all the cards that are in the deck. If the user is viewing another user's collection or a pre-made collection, the cards in grey are the ones that the user is missing. However, since we are focusing on a brand new deck, there will not be any cards. Therefore, imagine that the screen here is empty except for the "add card" dropdown menu and remove card option. Since we want to populate this deck, the user would hit the "add card" dropdown menu. The menu would then give two options: 1) Manual Entry or 2) Scan Entry. In this case, the user selects the "Manual Entry" option.

7. After selecting "Manual Entry," the user is redirected to the "Manual Entry" Page. Here, the user has the ability to search for what card they want if they know that card's name. They can also specify the genre and if it is a foil card or not. As they are entering in information, the search box below will populate will the most relevant results. Something important to keep in mind is that there is often more than one version of a single card, which is why the search box will display all the versions of the searched card. Once the user locates the card they want, they will click on that card's image.

8. After the user has clicked the image, they will be redirected to the "Card Details" page. This page gives a more thorough breakdown of the card being analyzed and provides important information, such as the name, a detailed description of the card, and a much larger image of the card that has all of its information on it as well. If this is the card our user has been looking for, then they can hit the "add card" dropdown menu in the bottom left. The menu will expand with a list of the user's decks and the user simply has to select which one it will be saved to. Once the user selects which deck the card should be saved to, they have successfully completed the task set forth to them. Now, let's go back and walk through the steps the user would have taken if they instead hit the "Scan Entry" option when adding a card to their empty deck.

9. If the user had hit the "Scan Entry" option, they would have been redirected to the "Scan" page. Here, the user would use a webcam or some sort of alternative image capturing device to scan in a card. Once the camera is focused in on the card and a satisfactory photo can be taken, the ready box at the top of the screen will become checked. Once the system identifies that the ready box was checked, it will redirect the user to the "Card Details" page for that card assuming it exists within our app's database. From that page, the user will perform the same steps as described previously and will have accomplished their task!
