# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Initial research revealed opportunities to disrupt multiple segments by addressing customer needs:
  *  <ins>High demand for web</ins>: Customers are satisfied with mobile but **also want a web version** to have a **larger screen** to view cards and collections

  * Interactive collections to **inform the user and guide them** through the process of building a pre-made collection
  * Robust scanning system that **quickly identifies and returns information** about the card scanned on screen
