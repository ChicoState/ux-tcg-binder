# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Initial research revealed opportunities to disrupt multiple segments by addressing customer needs:
  *  <ins>High demand for web</ins>: Customers are satisfied with mobile but **also want a web version** to have a **larger screen** to view cards and collections
  *  <ins>Camera scanning</ins>: Apps have **inconsistent scanning** features and websites **do not have scanning** in general
  *  <ins>Limited variety of cards</ins>: Majority of other products **specialize in one brand** of trading card game which is **extremely limiting**
  *  **Visuals** for collections of cards can be **misleading or confusing**.
  *  **Reluctancy to pay** subscription fee(s) for features

* New personas and scenarios reflect insights of user experience needs:
  * **Clear and simple** interface that requires very little hints on how to operate
  * **Seamless scanning** of cards and adding them to collections
  * **Sharing collections** with other users in order to **connect and share knowledge** with them
  * **Quick and easy modification** of created collections
  * **Card recommendations** for collections
 
* Sketches and diagrams illustrate initial concepts:
  * Clear and concise visual layout for **quick and easy navigation between features**
  * Create new decks with **custom settings, manual input, and scanning** for maximum user control and flexibility
  * Extensive library system to **efficiently search through and organize cards**
  * Interactive collections to **inform the user and guide them** through the process of building a pre-made collection
  * Robust scanning system that **quickly identifies and returns information** about the card scanned on screen
